**Software Testing Project Proposal**

*Spring 2020*

We propose creating a test input generator as our group project. This will allow us to test the efficacy of tests with a broad variety of inputs.

We intend to limit the scope of the test generation to HTTP requests in order to limit complexity. For example, we could generate various headers, illegally combine GET and POST, attempt SQL injection attacks, etc.

This project will be written in Java.
