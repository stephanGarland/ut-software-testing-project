**Software Testing Project Proposal**

*Spring 2020*

For our group project, we propose creating a software package which will generate input and validate appropriate results. This will allow us to test the efficacy of tests with a broad variety of inputs.

Using a simple HTTP server running in a docker container, we will automate a process which can create a variety of different HTTP requests. For example, we will generate various headers, illegally combine GET and POST, attempt SQL injection attacks, etc. We would then verify the correct responses from the server, and report those back to the developer.

This project will be written in Java.
